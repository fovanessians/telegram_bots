Add the following code to the start_bot() function:

dispatcher.add_handler(CommandHandler('get_image', get_image, filters=Filters.user(username="@YOUR_USERNAME")))
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your username.

This code will execute the get_image function, but only if the username matches your own.  With this filter we are only passing in 1 username, but you could also pass in a list of usernames.

Now letâ€™s create the get_image function:

def get_image(update, context):
    terms = ",".join(context.args).lower()
    update.message.reply_text(f"Getting Image For Terms: {terms}")
     command = context.args[0].lower()
    if("on" == command):
        context.user_data[echo] = True
        update.message.reply_text("Repeater Started")
    elif("off" == command):
        context.user_data[echo] = False
        update.message.reply_text("Repeater Stopped")
Like in the previous example we get the terms using the args variable from the context, but in this case we join the terms together with a , and convert to lowercase because that is what is required by the Unbounce API.

You can then get an image in the chat using /get_image and some keywords like this: /get_image mountain water nature
